# Visual Notes
A collection of visual notes about AWS services and features created with the [Notability app by Ginger Labs](https://www.gingerlabs.com/). 

# Contributing
One of the challenges associated with these diagrams, like other forms of documentation, is keeping them up-to-date. AWS frequently makes enhancements to services, adds new features, and changes service limits. Keeping up with all of these changes can be time consuming. I've recently started reducing the amount of detail found in diagrams, like regions a service is available, service limits, pricing, etc, in an attempt to reduce the frequency that updates need to be made.

To contribute changes to these diagrams you'll need to use the Notability app.
